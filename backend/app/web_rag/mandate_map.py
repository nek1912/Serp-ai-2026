"""P0-3 mandate map: data-driven, question-relative authority.

The JSON file (mandate_map.json, same directory) is DATA ONLY. This
module contains the small deterministic helpers that read it:

- anchors_for_domain(): subject + jurisdiction scoped anchor domains
  for the jurisdiction-first retrieval branch.
- mandate_fit(): publisher-competence ranking signal (0.0 - 0.30).
- document_role(): minimal instrument/implementation/explainer/
  secondary classification from conservative URL/title cues.

Authority scoring itself (source_tier, trust scores, gates) is NOT
replaced — these helpers only add question-relative signals.
