/**
 * Bridge from the browser to the FastAPI backend.
 *
 * HISTORY — why this file exists. The frontend used to call a same-origin
 * `/api/*` BFF (an Express server) which held CLERK_SECRET_KEY, attached a
 * bearer token, and forwarded to FastAPI. That server has been removed: the
 * browser now talks to FastAPI directly and sends the Clerk session JWT itself.
 *
 * Nothing here is a secret. CLERK_SECRET_KEY stays server-side inside Clerk and
 * FastAPI; the browser only ever holds the short-lived session token that
 * Clerk's own SDK mints. FastAPI verifies it against Clerk's JWKS in
 * backend/app/auth.py.
 *
 * The one thing this file must get right is the path mapping. The old BFF had
 * its own tidy URL scheme; FastAPI's routes are different. Keeping the mapping
 * in one table means a backend route rename is a one-line change here rather
 * than eleven edits across four files.

 * answers 401 — which is the correct, visible failure for an unauthenticated
