# Project: Multilingual Cooperative Governance & Legal Assistance Chatbot

You are assisting on an evidence-grounded, multilingual citizen-assistance PWA.

**Before doing anything else in a new session: read `PROJECT_STATUS.md`.** It
tells you what's actually built and what the current state is. This file
(CLAUDE.md) tells you the rules and stack that don't change.

## Non-negotiable principles

- The LLM is NEVER the source of truth. Every factual answer must be grounded in
  retrieved official documents with verifiable citations.
- If retrieval confidence is low or no supporting chunk exists, set `abstained: true`.
  Do not guess. Do not let the LLM override this in code.
- Never fabricate eligibility, amounts, dates, deadlines, legal clauses, or contacts.
- Grievances are PROTOTYPE references only. Always `is_official_submission: false`.
  Never claim real government registration or a real CPGRAMS integration.
- Central and state law can differ. Always attach jurisdiction + effective-date
  metadata. Never present a national/model rule as universally applicable across states.
- Every citation must map to a chunk ID that was actually retrieved in that request.
  Invalid citation → ABSTAIN.

## Stack (do not change without a logged decision — see DECISIONS.md)

| Layer | Technology | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Frontend | React 19 + Vite 8 + React Router 7 + Tailwind CSS 4 | Static SPA in `frontend-react/`. **Not a PWA** — no manifest, no service worker |
| Frontend API layer | Express 5 BFF in `frontend-react/server/` | Owns the 11 `/api/*` routes and injects the Clerk bearer token. **Never reintroduce route handlers on the client** — `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` cannot reach a browser bundle |
| Backend | FastAPI (Python ≥3.11) on Render Free | `uvicorn app.main:app` |
| DB + vectors | Supabase Postgres + pgvector (HNSW cosine) | 768d embeddings |
| Embeddings | Jina Embeddings v3 (primary) | 768d, task-typed |
| Embeddings fallback | Gemini embedding | 768d fallback |
| LLM primary | Groq (key rotation supported) | `groq_model` in config |
| LLM fallback | Gemini | `gemini_model` in config |
| Voice STT | Sarvam AI (primary) → Azure Speech (fallback) | |
| Voice TTS | Sarvam AI only | Azure excluded (bad Indic output) |
| Translation | Sarvam Mayura v2 (primary) → Azure Translator (fallback) | |
| Web search | Tavily (primary) / Firecrawl | for WebRAGService |
| Document parsing | MinerU `content_list_v2.json` | seed_parser.py |
| Reranker | Jina reranker (wired, disabled) | `RERANKER_ENABLED=false` |

## API contracts (current — match `backend/app/routes/`)

```
POST /chat
POST /chat/stream                 ← SSE streaming version
POST /voice                       ← full audio→STT→RAG→TTS pipeline
POST /voice/transcribe            ← STT only
POST /voice/speak                 ← TTS only
POST /grievance                   ← grievance REST endpoint
POST /grievances/finalize         ← finalize grievance (returns submission guide + translated data)
POST /grievances/fields           ← get grievance field schema for a stage
POST /grievances/clarify          ← answer clarification question
POST /grievances/answer           ← answer a specific field
GET  /conversations/{session_id}
GET  /evidence/{...}
GET  /health
GET  /health/providers
```

The frontend never calls FastAPI directly. Every request goes through the
Express BFF in `frontend-react/server/`, which owns these 11 paths (unchanged
from the Next.js app, so `src/lib/api.ts` needed no edits):

```
POST /api/chat · POST /api/chat/stream        ← both stream SSE from /chat/stream
GET  /api/documents/pdf/:filename            ← streams the PDF from FastAPI
POST /api/grievance/{answer,clarify,detect,finalize}
GET  /api/grievance/fields
POST /api/speak · POST /api/voice/speak       ← TTS; /api/speak returns binary mp3
POST /api/translate                          ← unauthenticated
```

Nine of the eleven attach a Clerk bearer token minted server-side.
Status codes are a contract the client branches on: **502** = upstream answered
non-OK, **503** = upstream unreachable or body unreadable, **413** = request body
over 1 MB. `proxySse` aborts upstream when the client disconnects or after
120 s. Clerk middleware is mounted on `/api` only.

Chat request: `{ question, session_id, language, ui_language_explicit?, state?, as_of_date?, history? }`  
Language values: `"en" | "hi" | "gu" | "mr" | "bn" | "ta" | "te" | "kn" | "pa" | "or" | "ml"`

Chat response: `{ answer, language, domain, intent, entities, confidence, confidence_level, citations, abstained, speech_text, speech_segments, follow_up_question, mode, conversation_id }`

SSE events: `thinking | step | token | metadata | done | error`

## Coding conventions

- Python: type hints everywhere, Pydantic models for all request/response bodies,
  no bare `except`.
- Every external provider call goes through an adapter with explicit timeout and
  fallback handling — never call a provider SDK directly from route handlers.
- Never put API keys in frontend code or commit them. Only `VITE_`-prefixed vars reach the browser bundle; `CLERK_SECRET_KEY`, `CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` and `BACKEND_API_URL` are read only by `frontend-react/server/`. The BFF refuses to boot without the Clerk keys — that is intentional, fail fast rather than 500 on first request.
  Backend environment variables only.
- Structured logs. Never log API keys, auth tokens, or full grievance PII.
- Write tests for: domain routing, jurisdiction filtering, retrieval, citation
  validity, abstention, grievance workflow, provider fallback.

## What's implemented (summary — see PROJECT_STATUS.md for full detail)

- ✅ `/chat` and `/chat/stream` — full dual-pipeline RAG (static + web in parallel)
- ✅ `/voice` — Sarvam STT → chat handler → Sarvam TTS
- ✅ `/voice/transcribe` and `/voice/speak` — standalone STT/TTS endpoints
- ✅ GrievanceWorkflow — 9-stage state machine, Supabase-persisted
- ✅ Domain classification — AnchorStore (keyword + cosine, floor 0.30)
- ✅ StaticRAGService — Supabase pgvector hybrid retrieval (dense + lexical RRF)
- ✅ WebRAGService — 10-step pipeline (Tavily/Firecrawl → BM25 → Gemini rerank → verify)
- ✅ Evidence gate, citation verifier, abstention
- ✅ 11-language frontend (EN, HI, GU, MR, BN, TA, TE, KN, PA, OR, ML) with chat, grievance, schemes, library pages. Coverage is incomplete: 791 of 3,740 strings untranslated (`npm run i18n:coverage`); missing keys fall back to English
- ✅ Document ingestion: 11 docs, 4778 chunks (pacs_governance, pacs_computerization, pmfby, financial_inclusion)
- ✅ Grievance localization — `FIELD_PROMPTS` (30 prompts), `SUBMISSION_STEPS`, `FOLLOWUP_PREFIX`, `WORKFLOW_PREFIX` maps in `translations.py`; `translate_field_prompt()` for field questions; frontend field card labels via `dictionaries.ts` i18n lookup

## When unsure

- Prefer code over comments — read the actual file before assuming what it does.
- Push back on scope creep, citing this file.
- State assumptions explicitly rather than silently picking one.
- Never invent APIs, repositories, or free-tier limits you haven't verified.
- At the end of every working session, update `PROJECT_STATUS.md` before stopping.
